- When reporting information to me, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Every bugfix requires a test, if there isnt one.
- Dont write long functions, break to several functions to keep readable.
- Never mix test code and production code.
- Use i18n keys for all user-facing text. Update lang files as needed.
- Dont delete debug logs until the user confirms bug has been fixed.
- Do not add comments
- Do not modify code you havent specifically been instructed to modify
- Do not rename functions unless you have been instructed to
- Do not refactor code unprompted
- Maintain clean and readable code
- If you dont know — say you dont know
- If an old unit test fails, dont modify the test to make it pass

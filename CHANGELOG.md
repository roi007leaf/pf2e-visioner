### üêõ Fixed

#### Critical Visibility Bugs

- **Greater Darkvision Feat Detection**: Fixed critical bug where player characters with the Greater Darkvision feat could not see through rank 4 magical darkness
  - **Root Cause**: VisionAnalyzer was only checking `actor.system.perception.senses`, which the PF2e system doesn't always populate when vision comes from feats (vs. ancestry traits)
  - **Solution**: Added fallback mechanism to explicitly check actor feats when vision capabilities aren't found in senses
  - **PF2e Rules Compliance**: Now correctly implements:
    - Greater Darkvision + rank 4+ darkness = **observed** ‚úì
    - Darkvision + rank 4+ darkness = **concealed** ‚úì
    - No darkvision + rank 4+ darkness = **hidden** ‚úì
  - **Backward Compatible**: Senses always take priority over feats; only applies feat detection as fallback

- **Darkvision Feat Detection**: Also fixed detection of regular Darkvision feat using the same fallback mechanism

#### Wall & Vision Fixes

- **Wall Change Cache Clearing**: Wall property changes now trigger proper cache clearing for VisionAnalyzer
  - Wall direction changes (left ‚Üí both) immediately recalculate visibility
  - Sight/sound blocking changes immediately update detection states
  - Observer conditions (deafened, blinded) properly re-evaluated after wall changes

- **Line of Sight in Darkness**: Adjusted line of sight checks to properly account for magical darkness in visibility calculations
  - Now correctly handles cross-boundary darkness scenarios
  - Improved detection of darkness along vision rays

- **Sight Blocking Logic**: Refined vision analyzer tests to use `canvas.walls.checkCollision` for accurate sight blocking
  - More consistent with Foundry's native vision system
  - Better integration with Wall Height module

#### Cover Detection Fixes

- **Wall Blocking Logic**: Updated wall blocking logic in CoverDetector for improved readability and accuracy
  - Wall direction tests adjusted to reflect changes in cover override logic
  - Better handling of partial walls and directional blocking

#### Action & Dialog Fixes

- **Visibility State Trust**: Updated visibility handling to trust AVS/getVisibilityBetween results
  - Removed redundant 'concealed' checks from conditions
  - Improved error logging in visibility helpers

- **Override Indicator**: Enhanced override indicator handling with proper cleanup
  - Fixed cleanup method calls after token deletion
  - Proper event listener removal

- **Tooltip Management**: Cleaned up tooltip visibility handling during canvas panning and hovering
  - Tooltips now properly hide during panning
  - Better state management for hover interactions

#### Feat Logic Fixes

  - now lets you override the cover applied to a roll in the roll dialog
  - now lets you set keybind that if held will let you override cover for the roll (for people that dont use roll dialog, you maniacs)

## [2.0.1] - 2025-08-12

### Fixed

- Auto cover:
  - now works with and without roll dialog
  - now gets reevaluated on token movement
  - walls intersection algorithm tuned to better check
  - removed any and cross modes

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-12

### Breaking - Full Internal Rewrite and Module Restructure

- Project reorganized and rewritten for clarity and performance.

### Added

- Auto Cover (reworked):
  - Applies cover only if the line from attacker to target passes through a blocking token‚Äôs space.
  - Lesser vs Standard cover determined by relative size (blocking token ‚â• 2 size categories larger => Standard).
  - Applies pre-roll via modifiers dialog or strike click capture; clears cover immediately after the roll‚Äôs message renders.
  - Multi-side evaluation: checks all token sides for walls; tokens use center-to-center line for accurate blocking.
  - Intersection mode for token blockers: new setting ‚ÄúAuto-Cover: Token Intersection Mode‚Äù with choices:
    - Any (default): center line intersecting any token edge counts.
    - Cross: center line must cross both opposite edges (top+bottom or left+right).
  - Ignore undetected blockers: new setting ‚ÄúAuto-Cover: Ignore Undetected Tokens‚Äù (skip blockers undetected to the attacker per Visioner map).
  - Respect token flag: new setting ‚ÄúAuto-Cover: Respect Token Ignore Flag‚Äù; if enabled, tokens with `flags.pf2e-visioner.ignoreAutoCover = true` will be ignored.
  - New token setting in vision tab: ignore as auto cover blocker.
  - Wall-level toggle: per-wall flag `flags.pf2e-visioner.provideCover` (when false) makes that wall not contribute to cover. Default set to true.
  - New wall setting: ignore as auto cover.
  - Prone blockers toggle: new setting ‚ÄúAuto-Cover: Prone Tokens Can Block‚Äù (default on). If disabled, tokens with a Prone condition won‚Äôt provide cover.
  - Ally/dead filters: existing settings integrated into auto-cover token filtering (ignore allies, ignore 0-HP tokens).
  - Gated by setting and enabled GM-only to avoid duplicates.
  - Auto-Cover live recompute: cover now recalculates when attacker or target moves/resizes during an active roll flow.
  - Auto-Cover blocker options:
    - Any (default)
    - Cross (ray must cross both opposite edges)
    - Ray through token center
    - Ray inside ‚â•10% of blocking token square
    - Ray inside ‚â•20% of blocking token square
  - Wall-level toggle: per-wall flag `flags.pf2e-visioner.provideCover` to exclude walls from cover.
  - Token UI: Ignore as Auto-Cover Blocker flag in Token Config Vision tab.
- Take cover action support
- Grouped Settings menu (ApplicationV2), scrollable, localized labels, and reliable select persistence.

- Seek Template and Range Improvements (stabilized from 1.x):
  - Strict filtering by player template (no generic fallback template).

- Chat Automation Quality of Life:
  - Point Out excludes loot, pings target on Apply.
  - Sneak lists only enemies (no allies).
  - Hide prerequisites enforced (concealed or standard/greater cover) and ‚ÄúNo changes to apply‚Äù notification when relevant.
  - Players don‚Äôt see Apply buttons in panels.

- API:
  - Bulk visibility setter to apply many observer‚Üítarget updates efficiently.

### Changed

- No more world reloads for several settings; they are now applied at runtime:
  - Ignore Allies, Seek template toggle, Seek range toggles, player tooltip toggles, auto cover.
- Hook registration centralized under `scripts/hooks/` with small registrars; heavy logic moved to feature folders.
- Imports largely hoisted to top-of-file for maintainability; kept dynamic imports only where lazy-loading is beneficial (dialogs, heavy batches).

### Fixed

- Hide action now respects the Ignore Allies setting (allied observers are filtered out).
- Auto Cover reliably applies to the current roll and then cleans up; prevents lingering effects.
- Template-based Seek respects only targets inside the player‚Äôs template and opens faster via sockets.
- Token Manager batch operations reconciled effects reliably and reduced redundant document operations.
- Sneak integration showing up on sneak attack damage rolls.

### Removed

- Legacy/unused files and integration paths related to the old effects coordinator code.

## [1.9.0] - 2025-08-11

### Added

- Stealth for loot tokens: Added possibility to hide loot from specific tokens and finding them with seek!
- Stealth DC override for loot tokens in Token Config:
  - Injected a Stealth DC number field into the Vision tab for loot actors.
  - Added a dedicated ‚ÄúPF2E Visioner‚Äù tab fallback for loot tokens when available.

### Changed

- Seek and Token Manager now respect the token-level Stealth DC override for loot tokens, falling back to the world default when unset.
- Removed Cover and visibility integration, rules will now explicitly follor enforce RAW setting

## [1.8.0] - 2025-08-11

### Added

- API: `api.clearAllSceneData()` to clear all per-token visibility/cover maps and all module-created effects across the scene, then rebuild and refresh visuals.
- Macros added:
  - Clear All Scene Data (calls `api.clearAllSceneData()`)
  - Open Token Manager(calls `api.openTokenManager()`)

### Improved

- Effects handling: will now use batching for better performance

## [1.7.1] - 2025-08-11

### Changed

- Enhanced tooltip size customization: Improved implementation of tooltip font size setting
- Added proper scaling of tooltip icons based on font size
- Added CSS variables for consistent tooltip sizing across all components
- Better responsiveness for tooltip elements at different font sizes

### Fixed

- Tooltips should now stick and not move with the canvas

## [1.7.0] - 2025-08-10

### Added

- Enforce RAW Setting: When disabled (default) will skip some conditions checks
- Multiple rules per effect: Instead of multiple effects, the module will now handle one effect with multiple rules per state

### Improved

- Memory optimization: Batch processing for visibility changes to reduce heap usage
- Token deletion cleanup: Automatically remove deleted tokens from visibility maps, visibility effects, and cover effects
- Performance: Optimized effect creation and updates to use bulk operations instead of individual promises
- Efficiency: Replaced Promise.all loops with direct bulk document operations for better memory usage
- Performance: Completely redesigned effect updates to batch all operations by state and effect type
- Performance: Implemented batched visibility and cover updates in token manager to drastically reduce individual updates
- UI Improvement: "Apply Current" now applies the current type (visibility or cover) for both observer and target modes
- UI Improvement: "Apply Both" now applies both types (visibility and cover) for both observer and target modes
- UI Improvement: Visibility Manager now closes immediately when applying changes and shows a progress bar
- Performance: Optimized cover effects system with bulk operations for better memory usage

### Fixed

- Chat Automation: Fixed encounter filtering not working properly for all actions (Seek, Point Out, Sneak, Hide, Create a Diversion, Consequences)
- Chat Automation: Fixed issue where players couldn't see the Seek template setup button when no valid targets were detected

## [1.6.1] - 2025-08-10

### Fixed

- Token Manager: Cover should now support highlight and go to row as well

## [1.6.0] - 2025-08-10

### Added

- Chat Automation: Added Apply Changes / Revert Changes to the automation panel for all actions

## [1.5.1] - 2025-08-10

### Changed

- Matching color for dialog theme on highlight row

## [1.5.0] - 2025-08-10

### Added

- Token Manager: Replaced Effects column with DC column in the Visibility tab.
  - Target mode shows Perception DC; Observer mode shows Stealth DC.
- New world setting: "Integrate roll outcome in the token manager".
  - Optional Outcome column compares the last relevant roll to the DC and displays degree-of-success (Success, Failure, Critical Success/Failure).
- Selection-based row highlighting across Token Manager and all action dialogs (Seek, Hide, Sneak, Create a Diversion, Point Out, Consequences):
  - Selecting tokens on the canvas highlights matching rows and auto-scrolls them into view.

### Changed

- Moved effects descriptions into the Current State tooltip.
- Unified PC and NPC table widths; responsive colgroups when Outcome is on/off.
- Outcome chip style matches action dialogs.
- If Outcome is enabled, the manager widens on open to ensure the column is visible.
- Removed hover-based row‚Üítoken and token‚Üírow behavior to avoid conflicts; selection now drives row highlighting.

### Fixed

- Correct DC tooltip text and header alignment.
- Layout glitches when Outcome is disabled.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-09

### Added

- Hover tooltips now show Font Awesome icon badges aligned above tokens:
  - Left badge: visibility state icon
  - Right badge: cover icon when applicable
- PF2e hud support for tooltip position

### Changed

- Hover tooltips no longer render text labels; icons are used for a cleaner, compact look.
- Badge positioning uses world-to-screen transforms, keeping alignment stable under zoom/pan.
- Create a Diversion discovery now considers both observed and concealed creatures as valid observers, and outcomes display only those who can currently see the diverter.
- Hide possible when token got observers and is concealed OR (has standard OR great cover)
- Effects will show token name rather than actor

### Fixed

- Token Manager: resolved ReferenceError for `pairs2` in target-mode apply flows.
- Tooltip cleanup reliably removes DOM badges to prevent lingering elements after hover/Alt/O.

## [1.3.3] - 2025-08-09

### Fixed

- Damage Consequences: Only list targets that explicitly have the attacker as Hidden/Undetected; removed global condition fallback.
- Damage Consequences button is hidden when no outcomes exist and shown when at least one target qualifies.
- Token Manager/Visibility Manager: Reworked layout to a single outer scroll container; inner tables no longer create nested scrollbars.
- Sticky footer no longer overlaps content; center area flexes and scrolls correctly.

## [1.3.2] - 2025-08-09

## Fixed

- CSS class overrding default system one (sorry!)

## [1.3.1] - 2025-08-08

### Added

- New world setting: Integrate Cover with Visibility Rules (`integrateCoverVisibility`). When enabled, certain actions obey cover prerequisites. Specifically, Hide is only available if the acting token has at least Standard Cover from an observer.

### Changed

- Chat automation now hides the ‚ÄúOpen Hide Results‚Äù button when no actionable changes are possible after applying visibility and cover checks (and the actual roll outcome when present).
- Hide observer discovery uses the same cover gating as the UI check to ensure consistency.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-08

### Visioner Token Manager (Visibility & Cover)

- Reworked Apply actions:
  - Apply Current now applies the active type (Visibility or Cover) for BOTH modes (Observer ‚Üí Targets and Targets ‚Üí Observer).
  - Apply Both now applies BOTH types for BOTH modes in one click.
- States persist reliably after changing type:
  - All map writes now merge into existing maps instead of overwriting.
  - Writes use `document.update({ flags... })` for stability.
  - Dialog refresh re-reads maps from flags on each render.
- Corrected table sorting per type (ally\npc):
  - Visibility order: Observed ‚Üí Concealed ‚Üí Hidden ‚Üí Undetected.
  - Cover order: None ‚Üí Lesser ‚Üí Standard ‚Üí Greater.

All notable changes to the PF2E Visioner module will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
